## Installation

![WebAssembly](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&message=WebAssembly&color=654FF0&logo=WebAssembly&logoColor=FFFFFF&label=)
![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&message=JavaScript&color=222222&logo=JavaScript&logoColor=F7DF1E&label=)

The easiest way to get started is by using one of these wrapper libraries that
already have all of the WASM host imports resolved.

For JavaScript users, you can use npm, [pnpm], [Yarn], or your other favorite
npm package manager to install [`hello-world-rust-wasm-component`] from npm.

```sh
npm install hello-world-rust-wasm-component
```

If you prefer to customize the Javascript ‚Üî WASM component bindings, you can
use [bytecodealliance/jco] to generate your own bindings.

<!-- For Python users, you can use pip, [Poetry], or another PyPI package manager to
install [`hello-world-rust-wasm-component`] from PyPI.

```sh
pip install hello-world-rust-wasm-component
```

If you're using Rust, you can install [`hello-world-rust-wasm-component`] via Cargo.

```sh
cargo install hello-world-rust-wasm-component
``` -->

## Usage

![WebAssembly](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&message=WebAssembly&color=654FF0&logo=WebAssembly&logoColor=FFFFFF&label=)
![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&message=JavaScript&color=222222&logo=JavaScript&logoColor=F7DF1E&label=)

You can use any [WASM host runtime for components]. You can find the API surface
and any imports you need to provide in [`wit/world.wit`](wit/world.wit).

For language-specific binding documentation, check out
[`hello-world-rust-wasm-component.js`].

## Development

![Rust](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&message=Rust&color=000000&logo=Rust&logoColor=FFFFFF&label=)
![WebAssembly](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&message=WebAssembly&color=654FF0&logo=WebAssembly&logoColor=FFFFFF&label=)

```sh
./build.sh
./build.sh --release
```

‚Ñπ You'll need [`wasm-tools`] installed which you can get via
`cargo install wasm-tools`.

The `wasi_snapshot_preview1.reactor.wasm` is the adapter module to shim the
component API over top of the existing WASI API. Keep it updated from
[bytecodealliance/wasmtime releases]. Since this is a library we want the
"reactor" version.

üöö To create a new release, don't use the GitHub UI directly; use the [draft
release] GitHub Actions workflow to create the initial draft release with the
compiled WASM artifact. Then you can edit that release and publish it as normal.
Make sure the `version` fields are correct before drafting the release; it's
used to choose the `v${version}` tag name for the release and in publishing.
Also try not to change the artifacts attached to the draft release; they were
generated by GitHub Actions.
