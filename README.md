## Usage

![WebAssembly](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&message=WebAssembly&color=654FF0&logo=WebAssembly&logoColor=FFFFFF&label=)

To get started just [download the latest WASM artifact] and use it in your
favorite [WebAssembly Component Runtime]! Make sure you provide any required
imports! 😉

## Development

![WebAssembly](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&message=WebAssembly&color=654FF0&logo=WebAssembly&logoColor=FFFFFF&label=)

```sh
./just build:debug
```

ℹ You'll need [`wasm-tools`] installed which you can get via
`cargo install wasm-tools`.

The `wasi_snapshot_preview1.reactor.wasm` is the adapter module to shim the
component API over top of the existing WASI API. Keep it updated from
[bytecodealliance/wasmtime releases]. Since this is a library we want the
"reactor" version.

🚚 To create a new release, don't use the GitHub UI directly; use the [draft
release] GitHub Actions workflow to create the initial draft release with the
compiled WASM artifact. Then you can edit that release and publish it as normal.
Make sure the `version` fields are correct before drafting the release; it's
used to choose the `v${version}` tag name for the release and in publishing.
Also try not to change the artifacts attached to the draft release; they were
generated by GitHub Actions.
